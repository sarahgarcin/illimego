Summary:

The project is inspired by traditional Mahorese architecture for the reinterpretation in a contemporary way, adapted to the place and uses.

This approach involves the use of local and bio-sourced materials with local know-how and techniques such as mud brick which is used for filling, and local wood for all structures, passageways and blacons.

The building templates resulting from a bioclimatic analysis, which makes it possible to create through housing, articulated around a central patio, naturally ventilated and protected from the sun and rain.
