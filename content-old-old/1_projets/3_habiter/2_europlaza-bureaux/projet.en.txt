Summary:

Designed by architect Pierre Dufau in the early 1970s, the Europlaza Tower was one of the first high-rise buildings (IGH) in La Défense.

The aim of the project is to requalify the office and common areas in order to update the offer of this emblematic building in the heart of La Défense business district.

The office layout is sober and elegant, with a touch of domesticity that is the hallmark of the agency. Likewise, the gym, auditorium and lobby have undergone a high-end refurbishment.

Text:

The Europlaza tower (former Septentrion tower) is an office skyscraper located in the business district of La Défense, France, on the territory of the municipality of Courbevoie (Hauts de Seine). Built in 1972 and completely renovated in 1999, it is 135 meters high for 31 floors.

The tower is located in the north-east of La Défense, on the edge of the circular boulevard and the avenue André-Prottin, on the territory of the municipality of Courbevoie. The Coeur Défense building, which overlooks the forecourt, is located just to the southwest.

The architect Pierre Dufau (1908-1985) was chosen to build a tower on a then unbuilt plot in the north of the new business district of La Défense1 - hence the first name of Septentrion de la tour.

Since its renovation in 1999 by the B&B Architects agency, the tower required an in-depth requalification of its spaces and functions in order to sustain and increase its attractiveness to increasingly demanding users.
