Summary:

Welcoming two nursery and elementary schools, the Paul Vaillant Couturier school group is reinventing itself as an open and innovative educational center, drawing inspiration from the archetypes of horticultural greenhouses.

Made up around a string of bioclimatic greenhouses housing a wooden case of high environmental quality, this "inhabited greenhouse" offers the advantage of great flexibility of use, modularity and reversibility.

This new educational tool becomes this unique place of learning where we can breathe, and where the gaze opens up to the sky, the air and the views.

This project is inspired by the archetypes of horticultural greenhouses, their structure.

Located along the Maurice Audin alley, it is built around a string of bioclimatic greenhouses, sheltering a wooden case of high environmental quality.

This wooden case is made up of timber frame walls. It welcomes the new programs of the educational pole, part of the transformation of the district towards a new "heart of the city".

Their volumes are linked by circulations in the open air, under the greenhouse, like so many covered and temperate agoras, practicable by the entire teaching staff, students, parents and other practitioners, like an educational tool.

Following a North-South axis, this "inhabited greenhouse" consists of six naves housing the various elements of the program. It is inserted in the extension of the "Square du Chêne Pointu" by a square obtained, thanks to a slight translational movement of the built volumes.

Matching the topography of the site, the project is part of a strong landscape and urban continuity, thanks to the visual link created between the square and the park of the Town Hall of Clichy-sous-Bois located in the background.

The new facade of the school complex can no longer be read as a watertight limit but on the contrary as a transverse device: porous but not passable by all. It fully organizes the necessary filter between public space and private common space.

What could be more obvious than to finally open the school to the city, even if the custom is to build each new school around an enclosure completely sealed off from the neighborhood.

Our ambition is to offer iterative support for all audiences, to attract curiosity to this unique object which is in the general interest.

Suggest the desire to be more attentive to what our children are experiencing, assure parents that their children will thrive and that this action can be shared with them, thanks to the programmatic amenities of this new equipment.

The educational greenhouse organizes a polite relationship with the existing school buildings, with its new nearby environment, street, alley, square, homes. This place is there to free itself from all the stigmas without derogating from the guarantee of safety for all users.

The intention is also to offer more surfaces for a lower construction cost. Proven, this arrangement makes it possible to create generous intermediate spaces; plots, passageways, terraces and balconies. This economic principle also makes it possible to have a large, full-height hall, distributing the floors via a wide internal street connecting the activities.

We are committed to offering a non-fixed place capable of producing open and flexible spaces, a place that evolves from a spatial and educational point of view. But we also want this project to be the bearer of strong ecological values.

The school of tomorrow, the first social and urban environment for children to experience, must be exemplary. In this sense, our "bioclimatic greenhouse" will be a real place of learning, a unique place where one can breathe, and where the gaze opens up to the sky, the air and the views.

Unlike a "defensive" climatic posture, the meteorological exchange systems at work will help create atmospheres or dynamic and interactive surroundings through their porosity.

Tempered in all seasons, but not air-conditioned, our bioclimatic greenhouse will allow children, as well as teachers and parents of students, to experience a different relationship with their "environment".

Unlike a "conditioned" space, the atmosphere of the greenhouse will cause greater freedom of action and sensitivity to day / night alternations, to seasonal rhythms, and, to its cycles, or, to the colors of the sky seen through the canopy.

Thus, the subtle variations in temperature and light, the caress of the wind, the evolution of the interior landscape with the seasons, will contribute to giving a "dreamlike" and "sensitive" dimension to this unique place of learning.
