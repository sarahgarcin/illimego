Summary: The design competition for which this project was created focused on environmental issues. The challenge we had to take up was the creation of a self-sufficient small scale floating architecture. The Lusatia region, in northern Germany, is filled with artificial lakes and canals, made in former brownfields’ excavations. This small floating house is designed like a solar wing, hence its name. Photovoltaic panels cover the “wing”, and a honeycomb wooden structure lets air and light in through the three sides of the house
