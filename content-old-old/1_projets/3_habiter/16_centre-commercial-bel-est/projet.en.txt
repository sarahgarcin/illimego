Summary:

USCO company managing the shopping center “Bel-Est”, considered several options to optimize its energy expenditure. One of these is the integration of a new façade covering the entire height of the current entrance. A curtain-wall steps into the street below a stone curved cladding strip.
With this extension of the façade, we wanted to dialogue with the built-up and unbuilt environment.
