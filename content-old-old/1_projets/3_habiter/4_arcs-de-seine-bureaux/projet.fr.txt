Summary:

Built Quai du point du jour in 1974, this tertiary complex signed by the New York agency SOM is made up of four buildings located on the banks of the Seine.

The agency is in charge of renovating office floors and lobbies in buildings A and B, plus the creation of a business center and a fitness room.

Text:

Emblematic of the landscape of Boulogne-Billancourt, the "Arcs de Seine" campus is characterized by the monumental arch which rises in front of its square and its facade patterns echoing the shimmers of the Seine below.

Building A has undergone partial restructuring with an increase in density by levels requiring the construction of a new fire escape staircase and the creation of a business-center and a fitness center on the garden level.

Building B has been completely redesigned by us, from reception to office floors and lift lobbies.

The spirit of the project tends to extend and renew the fundamentals of the building designed by SOM at the time; circulation and access are fluid and legible, natural light irrigates the workspaces in abundance.

Likewise, the choices of atmospheres reflect the spirit of the place by magnifying the light and the shimmering of the Seine counterbalanced by a touch of "domesticity" translated into the material by materials with noble essences; wood, stone and metal.

The whole contributes to a sober and elegant architecture which inspires calm and serenity.
