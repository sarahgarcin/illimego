Summary: Eventually, the Colombes urban farm project will promote the emergence of a genuine agrarian city. Hydroponic greenhouses along the A86 motorway, outside of Paris, will form part of the new Magellan residential area in order to provide fresh produce all year long. Likewise, outdoor gardens will contribute to seasonal harvests at the ground floor of collective housing!
