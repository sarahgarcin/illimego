Summary:

The design competition launched by the EPAMSA at Mantes la Jolie intended to renew the traditional business parc imagery.

Our proposal aims to initiate a “productive parc” comprising mix-used activities, warehouses, car parcs, hotel, offices and aquaponics greenhouses on rooftops.

The project site located in the city of Buchelay, benefits from a high visibility from the A13 motorway and will be in the near future well served by public transports (RER station, Eole line).

At the scale of the whole region, the Mantois basin encompasses 80% of “natural” landscape shaped by agriculture mostly.
Therefore, the question of feeding and local production has become the pivot point of our design.

Our proposal breaks with the conventional business park scheme and relies on the implementation of innovative agricultural activities such as permaculture and aquaponics.
These features will contribute to create the momentum for the future neighbourhood expansion, fostering commercial relations between local actors and short food cycles in the area.
