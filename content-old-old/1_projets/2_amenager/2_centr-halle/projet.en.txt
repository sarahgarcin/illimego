Summary:

In the context of the first session of the call for projects "Inventons la Métropole, du Grand Paris" (IMGP 1), we focused our interest on the central sector of the Plateau Central district of Clichy-Montfermeil.
The architectural project is the result of the hybridization of programs with a covered market hall associated with an Average Food Surface (MSA) and local shops, 156 generous collective housing units, all benefiting from outdoor rooms and an urban rooftop farm.
On an urban scale, a real virtuous ecosystem is set up with local production of vegetables, on-site sales, composting of market waste in connection with the large food hall and the open air market so popular in the region - all contributing to build the living environment of the future station district.

Connected to the future Grand Paris Express station designed by EMBT Mirales, the site is made up of a mosaic of places of which the "Anatole France" market forms the heart. Very popular, this open-air market is the starting point for a multi-site urban reflection bringing together the municipalities of Clichy-sous-Bois and Montfermeil.
We have imagined an urban project in resonance with the three poles of the new district: the Market, the Ateliers Medicis and the Station and the synergies that are created between them. At the same time, this new identity is anchored in the history of the place, at the local level but also at the level of the future Metropolis.
The Anatole France - Utrillo axis is designed as the heart of the new district, as a mixed axis that balances exchanges between the two municipalities, between commerce (the market) and culture (the Ateliers Médicis). Trade and activities will be brought to Montfermeil and culture to Clichy, the Anatole France-Utrillo axis is not made to segregate but on the contrary, to bring people together.
The architectural project is the opportunity to hybridize the programs with:

- A market, made up of a food hall and specialized sales areas intended as a multifunctional and evolving space. A space connected to the fairground market and more broadly to the city in a logic of spatialization of flows thanks to the implementation of a removable facade open to the Parvis.

- 156 collective housing units designed to evolve and adapt to the needs of their inhabitants thanks to the implementation of constructive devices allowing greater flexibility in extension and reconfiguration. To cope with the changing modes of living resulting from the break-up of the traditional family unit, we offer flexible and easily reconfigurable, expandable, adapted to the social environment and accessible to purchase.

- The establishment of a rooftop market garden offering the possibility of growing fresh fruit and vegetables whatever the season, generating jobs and contributing to the liveliness of the neighborhood.
