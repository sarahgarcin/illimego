Summary:

This development of a multisports hall will take place inside a semi-underground concrete construction, acquired by the Parisian suburb of Montrouge. This sports facility is designed to meet the needs of local clubs and nearby schools by housing a gymnasium for practicing and hosting game tournaments such as badminton, basket-ball, handball, tennis and volleyball.
The complex will be equipped with stands, with a capacity of 110 seats. Six changing rooms will include two for referees and judges.
We developed several propositions of finishing works, each one dedicated to maximizing warmth and light, in order to create the best possible environment for the sporting participants.
