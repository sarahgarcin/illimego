Summary:

Located in a wing of Lariboisière Hospital, this space forms part of an experiment to reduce the risks faced by drug addicts. It has been created in collaboration with the association Gaia who are the future administrators of the site.
Patients are directed along a set pathway from entrance to exit. Staff premises are located on the eastern part of the building and medical premises, are in the middle of the building. This facilitates a flow around these core facilities. The medical and social services are in direct connection with every stage of this path.
