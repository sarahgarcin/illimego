Summary:

Last Saturday happened the Torcy Island Alley official opening took place and was organised by Marne-la-Vallée conurbation committee.

On that occasion, we introduced publicly our Torcy Canoë Kayak Club’s nautical pole. Entirely built of wood, the nautical pole will be at the heart of an exceptional landscape site showacsing the ecosystem of the Marne riverbanks. Overhanging on the riverbanks, the diverse body of the building are placed in order that they evocate a fisherman village built on piles.

Fundamentally an ecologic conception, the new nautical pole is also the first Ile de France handikayak structure.
