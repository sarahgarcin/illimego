Summary:

A handi-kayak point in the Ile-de-France region in Torcy

If one project is important to us, it is the one we delivered last year to the attention of the TCK canoeing club (Torcy CanoÃ« Kayak).

Labeled Point Handi-Kayak Francilien, the site is open to able-bodied people of all levels, as well as users with disabilities.

We enjoyed working with the team members and thank them for citing us in their article.
