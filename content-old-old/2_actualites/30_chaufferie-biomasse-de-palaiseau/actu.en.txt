Summary:

FaÃ§ade being assembled

The last step before the completion of the new biomass boiler ... It will soon take part in the Camille Claudel Eco-quartier in Palaiseau, which is currently under construction. Assembly of the facade began today. The slatted panels arranged in cladding along the concrete envelope will create an undulation responding to the place !
